# next_background
This gem is to offer a WM agnostic solution to changing the wallpaper, either via CLI or daemon.

Notes
=====
At the moment this script has some severe limitations:
* Limited command line options.
* Very limited configuration
* Only works on XFCE4
* Only selects images that match a 16:9 ratio.

Current
=======
I am happy to say that in theory, this could work for you just fine. Given you run xfce4 and use a 16:9 monitor.  With that said, it should work juuuusst fine;) .

The Road map
============
I hate version numbers, they never work for me.  This is a short list of the major points I want to add before I consider this project 'public' worthy.  This is a short list of things I think need to be done before this is ready for public consumption.

* Mulltiple Monitor (dual and triple)
* Multiple WM's supported by a plugin model(this,in theory should allow it to work on Mac and Win with min work).
* Proper documentation and specs
